**🎉 Welcome to OS2ai on Github 🚀**  

You’ve arrived at OS2ai's main GitHub organization – the hub where we collaborate, innovate, and build a public sector GenAI open-source platform. 🏛️✨

**🌟 2026 A year of transformation**  

In october 2025 48 public institutions in Denmark decided to collaborate on a shared open-source GenAI platform 💪 In 2026 we scale the solution from one municipality to a community of public institutions and at the same time transform the product to form the base of an European interoperable GenAI stack for public institutions - we have work to be done!

✅ Establishing a strong community around the product 🤝  
✅ Scaling the product for wide usage in the danish public sector 🚀  
✅ Improve stack an ensure compliance to open Source standards 🔧  
✅ More structured and accessible repositories with open source components 📂  

We’re excited to have you here! Dive in, explore, and don’t hesitate to contribute or reach out. Let’s build the future of GenAI open source together!
