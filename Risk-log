## Suggestions for risk management methods:

I see two main paths for managing risks:


### 1: Using a simple markdown table for at traditional document approach 


A risk log could be built as a simple markdown table.
Collaborators will have to have a github account and know their way around making change suggestions via PRs.
The calculations will need to be done by hand offcourse.

**A simplistic (LLM created) example of a markdown table based log:**

### **Visual Key (Based on Risk Score)**

The emoji indicates the calculated risk level:

* **🔴 High Risk (Score $15 - 25$):** Requires immediate action and senior visibility.
* **🟡 Medium Risk (Score $8 - 14$):** Active mitigation strategy needed.
* **🟢 Low Risk (Score $1 - 7$):** Monitor only, or risk is mitigated/accepted.
### **Calculation**

* **Risk Score** is calculated as **Likelihood (1-5) x Impact (1-5)**.
* *High Risk:* $15 - 25$
* *Medium Risk:* $8 - 14$
* *Low Risk:* $1 - 7$
